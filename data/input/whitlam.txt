Well may we say ‘God Save the Queen’, because nothing
will save the Governor-General.

The proclamation which you have just heard read by the
Governor-General’s official secretary was countersigned
‘Malcolm Fraser’ who will undoubtedly go down in
Australian history from Remembrance Day 1975 as Kerr’s
cur.

They won’t silence the outskirts of Parliament House,
even if the inside has been silenced for the next few weeks.

The Governor-General’s proclamation was signed after he
already made an appointment to meet the Speaker at a
quarter to five. The House of Representatives had requested
the Speaker to give the Governor-General its decision that
Mr Fraser did not have the confidence of the House and that
the Governor-General should call me to form the Government.

Maintain your rage and enthusiasm through the campaign for
the election
